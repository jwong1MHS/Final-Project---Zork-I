# Final-Project---Zork-I
Recreating Zork I: The Great Underground Empire as closely as possible.

HOW TO PLAY:
For those of you who never played this game, it's a simple text adventure game that runs on simple commands such as "look", "examine", "take", etc., and compass directions are used as well to move, such as "north" or "northwest".
Your goal is to collect the trophies in the dungeon and return them.


SOURCES:
One of the online emulators that helped me was: https://archive.org/details/msdos_Zork_I_-_The_Great_Underground_Empire_1980

I mostly used the downloaded version from: https://gamesnostalgia.com/en/game/zork-the-great-underground-empire, which included a DOS version of the game which enabled me to work offline.


NOTE:
Yes this game will be incomplete, as the original game is very long. Also, there is no perfect online emulator of the game anyways, and the map of the game is very hard to crack. Likewise, I tried my best at trying to create this game, and I failed horribly. For a 1980s game, this sure is very complex.

As of now the only version that works is the zork_aboveground.py, since it's the most complete.
